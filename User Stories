As a user I want to:
  - play a game of hangman
  - so that I can have some fun
  
  - have a clue to the word I am guessing to spell
  - so that the game/word has a theme
  
  - see how many characters the word has
  - so that I can select the letters
  
  - see which letters I have already chosen
  - so that I don't guess the same letter twice
  
  - see where each correctly chosen letter fits within the word
  - so that I can determine which letter to choose next
  
  - see my score
  - so I know how I am doing
  
  - have hints to help me along the way
  - so that I have a better chance of winning
  
  - know when I win
  - so I can celebrate victory
  
  - choose the difiiculty level
  - so that I can be challenged
